# Simple_VideoPoker
Simple poker command line program for my final Pirple - Python Fundamentals project.

This was part of the final project in the Python Fundamental course given on 'Pirple', where we were supposed to choose one of the popular card games and implement a simple command line program to simulate the card game chosen using the knowledge of OOP principles gained. In this case, I chose to implement a version of Video poker.
